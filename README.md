# Community-Complaint-Portal
Developed a full-stack web portal to streamline community issue reporting and resolution. Implemented secure role-based access for Residents, Admins, Service Teams, and Master Admins. The system allows users to report issues with images, track resolution progress, assign technicians, and view analytics. Key features include token-based authentication, real-time issue tracking, comment logs, and admin approval workflows. Deployed the application using Render (backend), Netlify (frontend), and MongoDB Atlas (cloud database).
Highlights:
Designed REST APIs with Flask and JWT-based session management.
Developed responsive UI with modular dashboards for different user roles.
Built a scalable NoSQL schema to manage issue lifecycle and user roles.
Integrated live analytics, status filters, and admin control panels.
Achieved full deployment on cloud platforms with seamless frontend-backend communication.
